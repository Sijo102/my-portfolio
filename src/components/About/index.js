      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Hey, I'm Sijo Joshua, a down-to-earth web developer with a love for
        crafting digital wonders. I may not have a black belt in coding (yet!),
        but what I lack in experience, I make up for in enthusiasm and a
        willingness to learn.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Embarking on the Coding Journey</h3>
      <p>
        My journey into web development started 2 years ago, and it's been a
        thrilling ride of discovery ever since. I've dabbled in the basics of
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React JS turning simple lines of code into
        my very own web creations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Why Web Development?</h3>
      <p>
        The idea of creating something out of nothing has always fascinated me.
        Web development allows me to take my ideas and give them life on the
        internet. From tweaking the layout to adding a sprinkle of
        interactivity, I'm hooked on the process of building and improving
        digital spaces.
      </p>
